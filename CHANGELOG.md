# Change Log

## [0.7.0](https://github.com/duecredit/duecredit/tree/0.7.0) (2019-03-01)

- Prevent warnings from the injector's `__del__`.
- InactiveDueCollector in `stub.py` now provides also `active=False`
  attribute (so external tools could directly query if duecredit is 
  active) and no-op `activate` and `dump` for consistent API with a
  `due` object whenever `duecredit` is available.
- Provide `Text` citation entry for free form text. It does not have any
  meaningful rendering in BibTex but is present in text rendering.
  `Url` entry also acquired text rendering with prefix `URL: `.

## [0.6.5](https://github.com/duecredit/duecredit/tree/0.6.5) (2019-02-04)

- Delay import of imports (thanks [Chris Markiewicz (@effigies)](https://github.com/effigies)
  - serves also as a workaround due to inconsistent installation of
    3rd party modules/libraries such as openssl
	[\#142](https://github.com/duecredit/duecredit/issues/142)
- Use https://doi.org as preferred DOI resolver.
  Thanks [Katrin Leinweber (@katrinleinweber)](https://github.com/katrinleinweber)
  for the contribution
