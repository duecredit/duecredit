Description: duecredit is being conceived to address the problem of inadequate
        citation of scientific software and methods, and limited visibility of
        donation requests for open-source software.
        
        It provides a simple framework (at the moment for Python only) to
        embed publication or other references in the original code so they are
        automatically collected and reported to the user at the necessary
        level of reference detail, i.e. only references for actually used
        functionality will be presented back if software provides multiple
        citeable implementations.
        
        To get a sense of what duecredit is about, run for example shipped along
        example script, or your analysis script with `-m duecredit`, e.g.
        
            python -m duecredit examples/example_scipy.py
